# Rasa Express Chatbot Widget
This is an Node.js Express App placed in a Docker container for displaying a Rasa Express Chatbot Widget on a webpage for development purposes.  The Rasa server to handle the 
chatbot requests, is run within a separate Docker container, [Rasa Chatbot for Hackathon](https://github.com/ecsricktorzynski/rasa-chatbot-hackathon) container and must be started before this widget.
